1. Difference between let and var?

var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
Example:
let a = 'hello'; // globally scoped
var b = 'world'; // globally scoped
console.log(window.a); // undefined
console.log(window.b); // 'world'
var a = 'hello';
var a = 'world'; // No problem, 'hello' is replaced.
let b = 'hello';
let b = 'world'; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared.

2. Why are null,array printed as object type in console?

typeof null returns "object" because of a peculiarity in the design of the language, stemming from the demand that JavaScript be interoperable with Java. It does not mean null is an instance of an object. It means: given the tree of primitive types in JavaScript, null is part of the "object-type primitive" subtree.
